## [0] `whoami` --verbose

Welcome to my `localhost`. If you just want to parse my source code, you will find the directory tree compiled below. But if you want to inspect the human behind the machine, read on.

For the longest time, I was genuinely terrified of the blank IDE. I used to believe that programming was a restricted API meant only for developers with root privileges in mathematics. I didn't realize until I initialized this repository that coding is actually for people who are, simply put, **stubborn enough to forcefully resolve their own merge conflicts without terminating the process.**

This codebase is a live log file of my resilience. It holds the `stdout` of frustrating hours spent chasing logic errors, the silent exceptions thrown when CSS Grid refused to align, and the pure dopamine return code of `0` when a view finally rendered long after midnight.

I try to approach my architecture the way **Smriti Mandhana** approaches cricket: it is rarely about brute-forcing an `O(N^2)` solution; it is about elegance, patience, and timing. A quick hack might patch the bug, but a clean, thoughtful `O(N)` implementation sings.

These subdirectories are my learning environments. This is my core logic, hardcoded into every line.

## [1] `./eras/` (My Journey)

### [1.1] `source ./script_era.sh` (Logic & Dynamism)

**Index:**
* [`app.js`](./JAVASCRIPT/app.js) (Terminal Test)
* [`script.js`](./JAVASCRIPT/script.js) (JS Basics)
* [`brain.js`](./JAVASCRIPT/brain.js) (Variables)
* [`1.html`](./JAVASCRIPT/Variables%20and%20data%20types/1.html) (Data Types)
* [`operators.html`](./JAVASCRIPT/operators.html) (Operators)
* [`class2.js`](./JAVASCRIPT/class2.js) (Functions)
* [`conditionals.html`](./JAVASCRIPT/conditionals.html) (Conditionals: [`input.html`](./JAVASCRIPT/input.html) / [`grade.html`](./JAVASCRIPT/grade.html))
* [`loops.html`](./JAVASCRIPT/loops.html) (Loops: [`evenNumber.js`](./JAVASCRIPT/evenNumber.js))

**Status Check:** Active Runtime | **Vibe:** Strict Mode

HTML is the structure, CSS is the style, but **JavaScript** is the compiled binary. This era is about pure logic—functions, conditions, and the data pipeline.
* **Current Operations**:
  * **Memory Management**: Variables & scope (`var`, `let`).
  * **Operators Mastery**: 11 types of operators (`??`, `?.`, `...`, `in`, `delete`, etc.).
  * **Control Flow**: Functions, logic, `if/else`, and loops.
* **System Metaphor**: Game Awareness. Knowing when to invoke the right method to maintain optimal performance.

### [1.2] `import ./abyssal_era.css` (Layouts & Complexity)

**Index:**
* [`flexbox.html`](./SELF%20PRACTICE/CSS/flexbox.html) (Flexbox Protocol)
* [`grid.html`](./SELF%20PRACTICE/CSS/grid.html) (CSS Grid System)

**Status Check:** Captaincy Mode | **Aesthetic:** Deep Blue Environment

Mastering layouts in CSS is a complex algorithm but infinitely powerful. I architected the Grid with a bioluminescent aesthetic, making learning feel like exploring raw memory—scary, but beautiful.
* **Flexbox Protocol**: 1D alignment (`justify-content`, `align-items`).
* **Grid Compilation**: Abstracting `grid-template-areas` into a two-dimensional superpower.

### [1.3] `build ./architecture_era/` (The Discipline)

**Index:**
* [`cursor_landing_clone/`](./cursor_landing_clone/)
* [`Amazon Clone/`](./SELF%20PRACTICE/Amazon%20Clone/)
* [`Netflix Clone/`](./SELF%20PRACTICE/Netflix%20Clone/)

**Status Check:** Solid Defense | **Vibe:** Polished GUI

Building these UI clones was my load testing phase. It required patience, structural integrity, and pixel-perfect assertions.
* **Cursor Landing Clone**: A high-fidelity, dark-themed master component. Built using custom `-webkit-background-clip` gradients and glassmorphism.
* **The Root Lesson**: You cannot bypass the foundation. You build it div by div, component by component, keeping the DOM tree optimal.

### [1.4] `deploy ./folklore_era/Bharat_CV` (The Heart)

**Index:**
* [`Bharat_CV/`](./Bharat_CV/)

**Status Check:** Sincere Execution | **Type:** Print-Optimized

**This is the repository that means the most.**
I built this CV for my father, **Bharat Narula**. He has spent 20+ years compiling his knowledge of Chemistry for his students, shaping lives with the same patience I apply to debugging.
Building this wasn't about framework hype. It was about executing a script to give something back to the developer who bootstrapped my life. It is clean, sincere, and free of memory leaks.

## [2] `cat ./about_me.json`

I am building this path step by step, honoring the sacrifices my parents made to initialize my life's runtime environment, and striving every day to be a software engineer they can be immensely proud of.

```json

  "developer": {
    "name": "Sonam Narula",
    "status": "Compiling dreams into reality...",
    "vulnerabilities": {
      "biggest_fear": "UnhandledPromiseRejection - Wondering if my current stack is enough for the dreams I carry."
    },
    "runtime_environment": {

      "explanation": "Every broken build, every syntax error I created and wrestled with, has taught me how to write a more robust system."
    }
  }
}
