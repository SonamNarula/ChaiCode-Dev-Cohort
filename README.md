## 💭 `cat /var/log/honest_truth.log`

`cd /home/digital` // Welcome to my repository namespace. If you simply want to parse the source code, you will find it neatly mapped in the directory tree below. But if you want to inspect the human behind the machine, please extend your session timeout.

For the longest runtime, I suffered from massive imposter syndrome staring at a blank IDE. I assumed programming was a restricted API with a paywall of "natural talent" and advanced calculus metrics. I didn't realize until I cloned this journey that software engineering is actually for people who are, simply put, **stubborn enough to `git push --force` through their own merge conflicts without throwing an unhandled exception.**

This repository is not just a collection of blobs and trees. It is the live transaction log of my resilience. It holds the high CPU overhead of chasing phantom logic errors, the silent kernel panics when a CSS Grid absolutely refused to align on the main axis, and the overwhelming `HTTP 200 OK` dopamine hit of finally watching the DOM render perfectly at 3:00 AM.

I approach my system architecture the way **Smriti Mandhana** approaches cricket: it is rarely about brute-forcing an `O(N^2)` swing; it is about the elegance, the patience, and the execution timing. A quick, messy, spaghetti code hack might patch the bug, but a clean, thoughtful, modularly-architected `O(N)` solution sings.

These subdirectories are my memory partitions of learning. This is my core logic, hardcoded into the binaries.

## 🕰️ Compilation Phases (My Journey)

<summary><b>### ⚡ `Level 1:` The Script Runtime (Logic & Dynamism)</b></summary>
<br>

**[Terminal Test](./JAVASCRIPT/app.js)** | **[JS Basics](./JAVASCRIPT/script.js)** | **[Variables](./JAVASCRIPT/brain.js)** | **[Data Types](./JAVASCRIPT/Variables%20and%20data%20types/1.html)** | **[Operators](./JAVASCRIPT/operators.html)** | **[Functions](./JAVASCRIPT/class2.js)** | **[Conditionals](./JAVASCRIPT/conditionals.html)** (*[Input Practice](./JAVASCRIPT/input.html)* / *[Grading System](./JAVASCRIPT/grade.html)*) | **[Loops](./JAVASCRIPT/loops.html)** (*[Even Numbers Practice](./JAVASCRIPT/evenNumber.js)*)

> *"I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me."*

HTML is the structural DOM, CSS is the stylesheet rendering index, but **JavaScript** is the kernel. This phase is about pure logic—functions, execution contexts, and the data pipeline.
-   **Current Execution Threads**:
    -   **Memory Allocation**: Understanding `var`, `let`, and how variable referencing works in the heap.
    -   **Operators Mastery**: Comprehensively covering 11 types of operators (`??`, `?.`, `...`, abstract equality vs strict equality).
    -   **Control Flow**: Lexical environments, scopes, closures, and nested conditional routing.
    -   **Recursion & Iteration**: Loop stacks (`for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, and `for...in`).
-   **The Metaphor**: The "Game Awareness" subroutine. Knowing exactly *when* to execute a callback to maintain peak efficiency.

**[CSS Flexbox Protocol](./SELF%20PRACTICE/CSS/flexbox.html)** | **[Level 7: CSS Grid System](./SELF%20PRACTICE/CSS/grid.html)**

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Strategy-Captaincy_Mode-purple?style=flat-square" alt="Status"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Environment-Deep_Blue-00008b?style=flat-square" alt="Aesthetic">

> *"Meet me at midnight..."*

This is where I embraced the deep end of the stack. Mastering CSS layouts is a highly complex algorithm but infinitely powerful. I architected the Grid with a **Bioluminescent** aesthetic, making visual rendering feel like exploring raw memory—scary, but beautiful. 
-   **The Flexbox Protocol**: Realizing how beautifully simple elements can map onto a single 1D vector (`justify-content`, `align-items`).
-   **The Grid Matrix**: When I finally compiled `grid-template-areas` in my brain, it felt like unlocking a two-dimensional superpower in the viewport.

**[Cursor.com Landing Clone](./cursor_landing_clone/)** | **[Amazon Clone](./SELF%20PRACTICE/Amazon%20Clone/)** | **[Netflix Clone](./SELF%20PRACTICE/Netflix%20Clone/)**

> *"We never go out of style."*

Building these UI clones was my end-to-end integration testing. It required infinite loops of patience, strict structural validation, and pixel-perfect assertions.
-   **Cursor Landing Clone**: A high-fidelity, modern, dark-themed master component. It taught me the sheer processing power of custom gradients (`-webkit-background-clip`), GUI glassmorphism, and responsive `vw`/`vh` bounding boxes. 
-   **The Root Node Lesson**: You cannot bypass the foundation. Just like you can't bypass compiler errors. You build it block by block, div by div, component by component, keeping the DOM tree optimal.

**[Bharat CV (Special Project)](./Bharat_CV/)**

> *"The best people in life are free."*

**This is the repository that means the most.**

I compiled this CV for my father, **Bharat Narula**. He has spent 20+ years bootstrapping his knowledge of Chemistry for his students, shaping variables and lives with the same patience I apply to debugging.
Building this wasn't about framework hype or arbitrary library imports. It was about executing a script to give something back to the developer who passed all the core parameters into my life. It’s clean, it’s sincere, and it’s free of memory leaks.

I am building this persistent state step by step, honoring the background processes my parents ran to initialize my life's runtime environment, and striving every day to be a software engineer they can be immensely proud of.

| `process.env` Variable | Expected Output / Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `VULNERABILITY_LOG` | **An `UnhandledPromiseRejection`**—the imposter syndrome that my stack isn't deep enough to compile the dreams I carry. |
| `RUNTIME_REALITY` | **Incremental Optimization.** Showing up. Pushing commits. Refactoring my brain's architecture every single day. |
| `CORE_ALGORITHM` | *"I had a marvelous time ruining everything."* Every broken CI/CD pipeline, every `SyntaxError` I debugged, has taught me how to architect a significantly more fault-tolerant system. |
