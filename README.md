## 💭 The Honest Truth

Welcome to my digital home. If you just want to parse my code, you will find it neatly compiled below. But if you want to know the human behind the machine, please, stay a moment.

For the longest time, I was genuinely terrified of the blank IDE. I used to believe that programming was an exclusive API meant only for people who were "naturally gifted" or brilliant at calculus. I didn't realize until I started this journey that coding is actually for people who are, simply put, **stubborn enough to forcefully resolve their own merge conflicts without quitting.**

This repository is more than just files and folders to me. It is a live documentation of my resilience. It holds the frustrating hours spent chasing a logic error, the quiet tears when a CSS Grid simply refused to align, and the overwhelming, pure dopamine hit of finally watching a page come to life long after midnight.

I try to approach my code the way **Smriti Mandhana** approaches cricket: it is rarely about hitting the ball the hardest; it is about the elegance, the patience, and the timing. A quick, brute-force `O(N^2)` solution might get the job done, but a clean, thoughtful, well-architected `O(N)` solution sings.

These projects are my different "eras" of learning. This is my heart, hardcoded into every line.

## 🕰️ The Eras (My Journey)

<details open>
<summary><b>### ⚡ The Script Era (Logic & Dynamism)</b></summary>
<br>

**[Terminal Test](./JAVASCRIPT/app.js)** | **[JS Basics](./JAVASCRIPT/script.js)** | **[Variables](./JAVASCRIPT/brain.js)** | **[Data Types](./JAVASCRIPT/Variables%20and%20data%20types/1.html)** | **[Operators](./JAVASCRIPT/operators.html)** | **[Functions](./JAVASCRIPT/class2.js)** | **[Conditionals](./JAVASCRIPT/conditionals.html)** (*[Input Practice](./JAVASCRIPT/input.html)* / *[Grading System](./JAVASCRIPT/grade.html)*) | **[Loops](./JAVASCRIPT/loops.html)** (*[Even Numbers Practice](./JAVASCRIPT/evenNumber.js)*)

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Logic-Active-yellow?style=flat-square" alt="Status"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vibe-Reputation_Strict-333333?style=flat-square" alt="Vibe">

> *"I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me."*

HTML is the structure, CSS is the style, but **JavaScript** is the brain. This era is about pure logic—functions, conditions, and the flow of data.
-   **Current Focus**:
    -   **Variables & Scope**: Understanding `var`, `let`, and how data lives in memory.
    -   **Operators Mastery**: Comprehensively covering 11 types of operators, from basic Arithmetic to Unary, Object (`in`, `delete`), and Modern JS syntax like Nullish Coalescing (`??`), Optional Chaining (`?.`), and Spread (`...`).
    -   **Functions & Logic**: Basics of function definition and invocation.
    -   **Decision Making**: `if`, `else if`, and nested conditionals.
    -   **Iteration**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, and `for...in`.
-   **The Metaphor**: This is the "Game Awareness" phase. Knowing *when* to strike, and how to maintain consistency.

<summary><b>### 🌑 The Abyssal Era (Layouts & Complexity)</b></summary>
<br>

**[CSS Flexbox Protocol](./SELF%20PRACTICE/CSS/flexbox.html)** | **[Level 7: CSS Grid System](./SELF%20PRACTICE/CSS/grid.html)**

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Strategy-Captaincy_Mode-purple?style=flat-square" alt="Status"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vibe-Midnights_Deep_Blue-00008b?style=flat-square" alt="Aesthetic">

> *"Meet me at midnight..."*

This is where I embraced the deep end. Mastering layouts in CSS is complex but infinitely powerful. I designed the Grid with a **Bioluminescent** aesthetic, making learning feel like exploring the ocean floor—scary, but beautiful. The Flexbox module is where I learned 1D alignments, mastering properties like `justify-content` and `align-items`.
-   **The Flexbox Flow**: Realizing how beautifully simple elements can align on a single axis.
-   **The Grid Release**: When I finally understood `grid-template-areas`, it felt like unlocking a two-dimensional superpower.

<summary><b>### 🏛️ The Architecture Era (The Discipline)</b></summary>
<br>

**[Cursor.com Landing Clone](./cursor_landing_clone/)** | **[Amazon Clone](./SELF%20PRACTICE/Amazon%20Clone/)** | **[Netflix Clone](./SELF%20PRACTICE/Netflix%20Clone/)**

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Technique-Solid_Defense-blue?style=flat-square" alt="Status"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vibe-1989_Polished-1e90ff?style=flat-square" alt="Vibe">

> *"We never go out of style."*

Building these clones was my test match. It required patience, structure, and an eye for pixel-perfect details.
-   **Cursor Landing Clone**: A high-fidelity, modern, dark-themed masterpiece. It taught me the sheer power of custom gradients (`-webkit-background-clip`), glassmorphism, and responsive feature grids. It's aesthetically premium and fully responsive.
-   **The Ultimate Lesson**: You can't rush a good foundation. Just like you can't rush a century in cricket. You build it run by run, div by div, component by component.

<summary><b>### 📜 The Folklore Era (The Heart)</b></summary>
<br>

**[Bharat CV (Special Project)](./Bharat_CV/)**

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Dedication-Sincere-orange?style=flat-square" alt="Status"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Print_Optimized-brown?style=flat-square" alt="Type">

> *"The best people in life are free."*

**This is the project that means the most.**

I built this CV for my father, **Bharat Narula**. He has spent 20+ years teaching Chemistry, shaping lives with the same patience I'm trying to learn in code.
Building this wasn't about "flexbox" or "media queries." It was about using my new skills to give something back to the person who gave me everything. It’s clean, it’s sincere, and it’s full of love.
